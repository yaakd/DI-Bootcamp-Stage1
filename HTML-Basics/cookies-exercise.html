    <p>   Here is what the recipe calls for
<ul>Ingredients(probably not right...)
    <li>6 Eggs</li>
    <li>2 Cups of flour</li>
    <li>2 Tablespoons of vanilla extract</li>
</ul>

Instructions(may or may not be correct)
    Add eggs, flour and vanilla extract and mix
    Combine with sugar and baking powder and stir
    Eat half the cookie batter because it is delicious
    Take the rest of the cookie batter and make cookies
    Bake at 350 for 25 minutes
    Enjoy!
